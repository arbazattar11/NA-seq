# NA-seq Data Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to analyze NA-seq sequencing data. Below are the steps involved:

1. **Quality Control (QC) for NA-seq Data:**
   - FASTQ files are checked for quality using FastQC, and a summary report is generated.

2. **Read Alignment for NA-seq Data:**
   - Reads are aligned to the reference genome using BWA, and sorted and indexed BAM files are generated.

3. **Differential Expression Analysis for NA-seq Data:**
   - Perform differential expression analysis if comparing between different experimental conditions using tools like DESeq2 or edgeR.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Visualize and interpret the gene expression changes.

## Usage
- Clone this repository.
- Place your NA-seq FASTQ files and reference genome in the same directory as the pipeline script.
- Modify the script as necessary to specify paths and parameters.
- Run the pipeline using `./pipeline.sh`.

## Requirements
- BWA
- Samtools
- DESeq2 or edgeR (for differential expression analysis)
- FastQC
- R (if performing differential expression analysis)

## Notes
- Adjust parameters and additional analysis steps based on specific experimental needs.
- Ensure reference genome files are available and properly indexed.
